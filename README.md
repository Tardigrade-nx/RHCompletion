# RH Completion

**RH Completion** is an Android app for [RetroHandhelds community](https://retrohandhelds.gg/)'s 'GotX' (Game of the Week/Month/Quarter/Year). For more details, join the RetroHandhelds [Discord server](https://retrohandhelds.link/Discord).

It simply displays a floating note over the emulator window, with your configured nickname and the current date. With the app running, you can take your completion photo without having to write down your nickname and current date on a piece of paper.
When using the app, please take a real photo, not a screenshot, and mention the game name on your completion post, as usual.

Here's an example of a completion photo using the app:

## Installation

**RH Completion** can be installed on an Android device manually, from an APK file:

- Download the APK file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Tardigrade-nx/RHCompletion/releases)
- Copy the APK file on your device
- On your device, from a file manager, click on the APK file to install

## Usage

When launching the app for the first time, you will have to give permission for 'Display over other apps'. This is mandatory, for obvious reasons.

Then, you will have to configure:
- Your nickname (same as the Discord one)
- If needed: the width of the floating note, as a percentage of the screen (by default: 50%)

Subsequent launches will open the floating note directly.

When the floating is opened:
- You can move it anywhere on the screen
- Close it with the 'X' button (upper-right)
- Go back to the settings screen with the 'settings' button (upper-left)
